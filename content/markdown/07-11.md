I’m up far too early with jetlag, but make the most of it by getting ready to set out right after breakfast at a Tully’s Coffee on the ground floor of the hotel. Japan is the only place where the Tully’s coffee chain from Seattle still operates. It’s nothing special but it feels a bit nostalgic to eat there — we used to have a Tully's just down the block from our house.

I take a train to the seaside town of Numazu, then a cab to Senbonhama Park on the Pacific Ocean. I step into the water so I can definitively begin my hike across the island of Honshū at the very edge of the land, then begin walking inland. It’s nice to start the walk with a pleasantly shaded park — it’s already warm out, and it’s going to get extremely hot and muggy today.

My route today is entirely urban, but it roughly follows the course up the Kano River and then the Kise River, so some of the time there’s a nice view. By mid-morning it’s quite hot, so I stop at a Family Mart convenience store for a drink and snacks. I walk a short distance to Ayutsubo Falls and rest in the shade while snacking.

From there I walk a small distance to a spot on the map labeled, “World’s Smallest Park”. This turns out to be a tiny 0.25 × 0.25 meter square with a bit of greenery and a tiny bench stool to sit on. There’s a rock nearby that certifies its smallest park status. I sit on the bench before continuing on.

I enter the city of Susono, where my route happens to take me right by the home of our friend Beth, whom I met in 1988 at Waseda University. Sadly, Beth’s not at home — ironically, right now she’s visiting family in Washington State.

By lunchtime I’m eager to find an air-conditioned place to eat lunch. The first couple of promising places don’t work out, but I finally find a Korean barbecue restaurant. The food’s fairly good, and I’m glad I’m out of the sun.

I don’t have far to go to reach my hotel for the night, but stop anyway at a Doutor Coffee so I can cool off again before going on.

I’m happy when I finally reach the Rembrandt Gotemba Hotel on the side of a big highway. It’s only 2:45, and it turns out that check-in isn’t until 4:00. Like many Japanese establishments, this hotel is keen to maintain the rules, so I have to wait until 4:00 before I can get into my room. It’s nice to use the hotel’s bathhouse then rest a bit.

There are very few dining options around the hotel, so I make do with dinner at a cafeteria at a Lawson convenience store / cafeteria / gas plaza. The cafeteria food isn’t great, but better than a cold meal from the convenience store. Since I’m there, I stock up on snacks; from what I can see on my map, there won’t be any stores like this for the next few days.
