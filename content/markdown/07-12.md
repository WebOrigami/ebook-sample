I get breakfast from the Lawson next door, and take the opportunity to grab a 1 liter sports drink — it’s going to be hot again today, and I’m concerned that just drinking lots of water could lead to hyponatremia (low sodium).

Today’s walk is rural, but unfortunately it’s almost entirely along rural highways. These sometimes don’t have a substantial shoulder to walk on, and there are very few people walking alongside them, so drivers aren’t particularly looking for pedestrians.

At one point, I pass a concentration of buildings that’s some sort of school or research institute. A fair number of people are arriving for the day; I’m going against the flow. To cross a road through the buildings, I have to use a pedestrian bridge. On the other side, I find that the stairs descend directly into a large parking lot surrounded by a barbed wire fence. It takes a while to find an exit on the other side.

All morning I hear loud booms that sound like explosions from not too far away. I later learn that these are coming from a nearby training ground for the Japan Self-Defense Forces. That would also explain the olive drab jeeps and trucks that occasionally pass by.

The rural highway keeps climbing as it makes its way in the direction of Mount Fuji. I enter a cedar forest, where I’m suddenly surrounded by a haunting Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki-Ki noise that constantly rises and fades. This sound follows me for the rest of the day. I ask someone about it, and the sounds are made by a type of cicada.

Last night I’d searched a map of this area for someplace I could stop for lunch. I was stunned to see a cute little restaurant called Nog Cafe in the middle of this forested area, so I called ahead to make a reservation. I have to detour to reach it, and it’s nice to be off the main road. The cafe is charming, and it’s a relief to sit down in the air-conditioned space that looks out over trees. The lunch special of sauteed lemon chicken is delicious on its own, but comes with a set of pretty and tasty side dishes.

After lunch I head back towards the main road, puzzled why the walking directions in Google Maps want me to take a big detour. I eventually come to a big sign announcing that the road going forward is an expressway where pedestrians are forbidden. I have to backtrack a fair distance and then take the big detour.

The detour itself is also concerning. I enter an area with another sign saying, “Dead End”, and explaining that beyond the sign is a golf course and some country homes, with no exit on the other side. I check the map and, sure enough, Google’s directions take me _very close_ to the camping resort where I’m staying tonight — but the directions show a dotted line from the road to the destination as if to say, “Figure it out yourself”.

From the satellite view, it looks like there _may_ be a back entrance to the resort. Since I have essentially no other option, I walk ahead, hoping that I don’t have to trespass through someone’s backyard to get to the resort. Luckily, I find the hoped-for back entrance to the resort and head in.

The reception desk is closed for the moment, so I get a drink and wait on a porch. Eventually a man comes by to check me in. I ask about the expressway that’s closed to pedestrians, as it might be the only way to get to a trailhead on Mt. Fuji tomorrow. He explains that pedestrians aren’t really allowed, but people do walk on that road without getting bothered. But if I’m heading to the trailhead, he says, he’s pretty sure there’s another trailhead that’s closer and avoids a long walk on the expressway. He digs around through various maps and brochures until he finds one that shows me where I should go tomorrow.

This place is a “glamping” resort, mostly with geodesic domes with comfortable interiors. They also have a handful of Airstream “Bambi” RVs, and it’s one of these that I’ve rented for the night. I’d been keen to try one in the States but hadn’t had the chance, so figured I’d try it here.

There’s a little enclosed gazebo next to the camper with a grill, and the lodging comes with all the fixings and utensils to cook a barbecue dinner. It’s far too much food for me, but I do my best. Surprisingly, my favorite part of the meal is a Japanese sweet potato. I don’t particularly care for them, but after cooking it for a long time on the grill and adding some seasoning, it’s fantastic.

Tomorrow I’ll start climbing Mt. Fuji in earnest.
