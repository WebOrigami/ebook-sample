It takes a bit of time to leave in the morning — the resort has provided me with ingredients for a big breakfast, and it takes a while to cook it and eat as much of it as I can. I’m on the road by 8:00 am. Just as I set out, it begins to rain.

The only way to reach the Suyamaguchi Trailhead is to scurry along the expressway that’s forbidden to pedestrians. As expected, this trailhead is so low down on Mt. Fuji that no one starts their hike here. Thankfully, the trail is still part of the Mt. Fuji national park, so it’s well maintained. There are pink ribbons tied to trees every so often to mark the trail, and each time I see one I’m happy to know I’m still on the right track.

Portions of the trail are steep and gnarly with roots, like the Old Trail up Mailbox Peak near Seattle. At one point, the trail passes near another camping resort called Fuji Grinpa. Through the trees I can hear a PA system announcing something. At one point, I’m surprised to see an enormous rusting Ferris wheel looming overhead. The forest trail then passes within striking distance of a golf course — in places there are lots of golf balls on the trail.

It rains all morning. I reach an outpost of civilization at Mizugatsuka Park, where there’s a large parking lot and a rest area. I go inside and warm up over coffee. I see a couple of families of Europeans taking a break. One of them, a father from Nantes in France, comes over to say hello and talk for a bit.

Continuing up, the next bit of forest trail has a couple of hikers on it, but they seem to be day-hiking from the rest area; after a short while, the trail is empty again. At some points I can turn around and see through breaks in the clouds to the coastline. I’m getting pretty high up.

As I climb, the character of the forest changes: the trees keep getting shorter and shorter, until they’re finally only as tall as me. The ground changes to loose volcanic grit, and the trees are replaced with small tufts of green. The rain stops, but it’s now quite windy; I have to keep changing my outfit to suit the conditions.

There are four hiking routes to the top of Mt. Fuji. I’m heading towards a junction with the Fujinomiya Route. Like many Japanese trails to a mountain summit, the trail has markers called “stations” numbered from 1 to 10 (the top). On Mt. Fuji, many of these numbered stations have huts to accommodate hikers and serve food as well. On the Fujinomiya Route, everyone (else) starts at the bus drop-off at the 5th Station.

I eventually reach the Fujinomiya Route at the 6th Station. Having hiked for hours seeing essentially no one, I now meet a river of hikers trudging up the mountain.

I make the final slog up to the 7th Station and a hut called Goraiko Sanso, where I have a reservation for the night. In contrast to the usual high level of service in Japan, the people who check me in seem quite abrupt, presumably jaded tending to the endless stream of hikers. The vibe in the hut itself is much more subdued than I’d expected. There are a few groups of people sitting around tables on the floor of the main front room, but there’s not much talk.

The hut accommodations are akin to a capsule hotel: sleeping areas have two levels of beds with dividers between them, giving everyone a long box-shaped area to themselves. Each unit has a light switch and an outlet for charging things. I’m happy to unpack my stuff, visit the weird high-tech composting toilet rest room, then take a nap.

After waking up, I walk back into the main room. A Dutch man introduces himself; he recognizes me from the rest area at Mizugatsuka Park. His name is Gauke, and he’s traveling with his wife Christine and grown children Rosa and Gauda. Gauke and I talk for a while until his other family members rouse themselves from naps. We decide to share a drink, but the staff are clearing out the main room to prepare for dinner, so we have to bundle up and take our drinks outside. It’s not too cold out, but it’s still pretty windy.

Tonight I’m looking forward to a hot meal. The staple dinner at Japanese mountain huts is curry rice, but I can’t say the hut’s curry rice is very good. It is hot and filling, but that’s about the best that can be said of it. When the Dutch family has a chance to order their own meals, they sit down and join me at the low table on the floor. None of us can get really comfortable at the table, and my legs are already pretty sore as it is. Gauke seems to be having similar trouble bending himself into a position where he can eat. I quip, “Gauke, you look like a pretzel!”, and his family members all laugh.

Before bed I check the weather forecast. I’d been wondering whether I should try to wake up in the middle of the night and join the crowd of people hoping to see sunrise from the top. But the forecast calls for rain overnight, then clouds in the morning. Hiking a steep trail in the dark _and_ in the rain _and_ at high altitude sounds like a recipe for misery, particularly if morning clouds will prevent anyone from actually seeing the sunrise. Instead of 2:00 am, I set my alarm for 6:00 am.

Okay, the food is terrible, but are the hut’s futons comfortable? No.
