I’m glad I brought earplugs, because even with them in, I was still woken up many times. Every hour of the evening and night brought a new group rousting themselves out of bed to make noisy preparations for departure.

The hut’s breakfast is a pre-bundled set of packaged food, all of which is terrible. For the record, this hut had better reviews than many others.

I set out at 7:00 am for the top. It’s a long, slow slog to the huts at each of the stations. I’m happy when I get close to what I think will be the 8th Station, only to find that it’s actually an intermediate station called the Old 7th Station. So I still have further to go. Likewise, after the 9th Station, there’s an extra hut called the 9.5th Station.

Mt. Fuji’s slopes have a famous curve that gets steeper as it approaches the top. This curve looks beautiful in a woodblock print, but makes for an ever-harder climb.

I’m very happy to finally see the torii gates that mark the shrine at the summit. I finally reach the top, and pop inside the shrine to warm up for a minute and change outfit layers. The plaza in front of the shrine alternates between being socked-in by clouds and suddenly affording expansive views far to the north and south.

I hike around Mt. Fuji’s summit caldera, going counter-clockwise from the south-facing Fujinomiya Route to the north-facing Yoshida Route. At the top of the Yoshida Route, there’s a tiny little village of stone buildings with restaurants. I buy a piping hot can of milk tea.

Last night it hit me that my hiking plan for today had overlooked a critical fact. Normally I focus my hike planning on distance and elevation _gain_. Today has 3000 feet (914 m) of elevation gain, which is fine. But what I’d overlooked is that today I also have to _descend_ a punishing 9000 feet (2743 m) from the top of Mt. Fuji all the way to the shore of Lake Motosuko. My knees are going to hurt like hell, and tomorrow it will be difficult to walk. But there’s nothing for it, so I start down.

After descending for 10 minutes or so, I realize that this Yoshida Route actually has separate trails to keep ascending and descending hikers apart — and I’ve chosen the wrong trail. I can see the descending trail from where I am, but there’s no way to get to it. I have to apologetically make my way around hundreds of hikers who are climbing up, including a very long line of young Japanese soldiers presumably doing the climb as training. I even see a couple of trail runners.

I’m happy when I finally reach a point where I can cut over to the descending trail, which makes an endless series of switchbacks on very loose volcanic grit. This goes on for a few hours. One thing I’ve noticed on Mt. Fuji is how few people seem to be having a good time. There are occasional groups of twenty-somethings who are laughing as they take a break at a station, but everyone else seems to be pretty miserable.

Hikers talks about "Type 1 Fun": something that is actually fun while you’re doing it. Type 2 Fun is something that is only "fun" in retrospect — when you have forgotten the miserable parts — or fun in the retelling of the misery. Climbing Mt. Fuji is definitely Type 2 Fun.

Shortly before reaching the 5th Station, I come across a pair of young TV reporters for the channel TBS who are interviewing hikers. They ask if they can interview me, and I say yes. Like most people I’ve spoken with, they’re surprised by the long hike I’m doing, so we talk for quite a while. After we’re done, I move on before I think to ask them how to find out whether and how they’ll use the interview.

The 5th Station is the main trailhead for the Yoshida Route, but it’s not like any trailhead I’ve ever seen before. It’s more like Disneyland: a sea of people in a plaza surrounded by restaurants, gift shops, and gear rental companies. By now it’s 1:00 pm, and I still have many miles to go today, so I eat a quick lunch and keep going. While the _ascending_ Yoshida trailhead is packed with people taking selfies, the nearby _descending_ Shijoguchi trailhead is of no interest to anyone. I start down the deserted trail and will not meet any other hikers for the rest of the day.

Having already dropped 6000 feet (1800 m) by this point, my knees are complaining. Happily the trail itself, while completely unused, is extremely well-maintained and easy to follow, so I can at least make good speed. My goal for tonight is a lakeside campground with rental cabins, and I’m worried about whether I’ll be there in time to check in, so I hustle as fast as I can. I’m a little surprised to find that there’s cellphone coverage in the middle of this remote forest, so I can call the campground and they reassure me that someone will be in the office when I arrive.

While the Shojiguchi Trail is excellent, it’s heading to Lake Shoji, and I’m going to neighboring Lake Motosu. I eventually reach a junction where I have to take a different trail. It becomes apparent that this other trail barely exists: it’s an old, overgrown forest road that isn’t maintained and doesn’t look like it’s seen use for years. The trail is just barely clear enough to follow, and I have to keep checking my phone to confirm that I’m still on the trail.

I’ve almost reached Lake Motosu when I come to a final obstacle: a barbed-wire gate and fence across the forest road. I have no idea why it’s there; the area on the other side looks like private property. There was a fork in the road a minute ago — maybe that’s the right exit? I back up and take the other road. That road leads to a barbed-wire fence too. I’m very close to a main road — I can hear road noise — but it’s unclear how to reach it without trespassing.

I finally bushwhack through a bit of forest to come to gap between private property, and am relieved to reach the main road. Now I just have a few more miles of road walking around the lake to reach the other side where the campground is.

I’d picked this place, Koan Camping Ground, because it was one of the only lodging options in this area — but also because the campground was featured in the first episode of an anime series about camping that Bree and I liked called, _Laid-Back Camp_. When I reach the campground, it’s clear the anime creators were meticulous in depicting the camp office, the campground, and the lakeside view. The view itself is very famous: the Japanese ¥1000 note includes a view of Mt. Fuji as seen from this spot on Lake Motosu.

There’s a bit of fuss to get checked in, and then I get the keys to a tiny cabin for the night. I stop at the tiny shop next door to pick up instant Curry Noodles for tonight’s dinner. Those noodles were eaten by the two protagonists in the first episode of _Laid-Back Camp_, and in any event are the most elaborate meal I can make with the cabin’s provided burner and tea kettle.

My cabin’s close to the lake. I walk along the wide beach towards the building with coin-op showers. The beach is packed with the cars and tents of weekend campers. It’s my impression that camping is still a somewhat unusual pasttime in Japan — I think most of our Japanese friends have never been camping — but the people who do camp really go all out with camping gear. Many couples and families have set up tarps next to their tents, under which they have created elaborate set-ups that are half kitchen, half living room.
