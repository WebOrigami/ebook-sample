title: July 15 ～ Day 5

It’s more instant noodles for breakfast! I walk past all the campers on the beach, and get a bit of a Mt. Fuji view before heading out.

The day starts with a walk through a very long tunnel. Happily, all the many tunnels I have to walk through today have nice sidewalks on both sides, so they feel completely safe. That said, after the tunnel’s over, I return to walking on the narrow shoulder of a narrow highway. This particular road is fantastically twisted, switching back and forth along a steep, lush mountainside. Drivers are generally courteous in trying to give me room, but there are many blind hairpin turns. Coming out of the turns, the drivers often make a surprised swerve toward the middle of the road when they see me.

At one point I’m puzzled by what I see coming up ahead in Google Maps: the walking route it proposes _loops around on itself_. I really can’t imagine why it would show a loop. When I get to that point, it’s yet another tunnel — but this one spirals down inside a mountain to reach a lower elevation. I can’t imagine the cost of building a spiral tunnel like that. It’s somewhat eerie to be walking for twenty minutes or out of sight of both the entrance and the exit, with no real sense of progress.

All day long I walk down out of the mountains. At one point, Google has me cut away from the main road through a quiet hamlet. The route seems to be heading for a high ridge, and I dread having to climb up and over it. I pass the last house, and notice leaves and branches littering the mossy road. No one comes this way. Then the road turns a bend — and there’s another tunnel straight through the mountain ridge. This is an ancient, long, single-lane, drippy tunnel. It feels abandoned. Amazingly, there are still flourescent lights lit at intervals through the tunnel. I walk through and, a short while later, reach another hamlet.

It takes the rest of the morning to reach the small town of Ichikawamisato. There are only a few restaurant options for lunch, so I head for one called “Mohen” that has good reviews. It doesn’t look open — but it does have a small sign that says “Open”, so I give the door a try. The door opens onto what looks like it was once a restaurant lounge, with big chairs, a bar, and a TV. But there’s random personal stuff everywhere, like a hoarder’s house. Maybe this used to be a restaurant, and is now out of business? There’s an old man sitting in one of the chairs. He’s watching the TV, and hasn’t noticed me yet. I slowly close the door and back away.

The next restaurant is definitively closed, and there aren’t many choices left. Happily, a restaurant called Kawachi is open, looks fine, and actually has some other patrons. The old woman behind the bar points me to a counter seat. I get soba noodles with a side of tempura, and it’s all pretty good. A cook (her son?) hands her a small dish, which she hands to me. This is a small dish of shiso leaf-wrapped fish that’s been fried in tempura batter, and it’s on the house. I tell her it’s very good, and she replies that she’s happy to hear it - the shiso comes from her neighbor’s garden. She asks whether I’m traveling, and we end up talking about my hike.

I pay and thank her for the meal, then head out to the parking lot to get directions to my destination for the day. Now that I’m back at a lower elevation, it’s really hot again. Suddenly, the woman comes running out after me holding a plastic bottle of cold green tea, giving it to me and wishing me the best at walking in the heat.

There’s a long walk along a fairly busy highway to reach the edge of a small city called Minami Alps. Google’s walking directions are very occasionally frustrating (it tries to route me through a private office park) but sometimes serendipitous (it routes me along a long embankment by the beautiful Kamanashi River).

There weren’t great hotel options in this city, and it was cheaper to rent a house through AirBnB. It’s in a neighborhood that’s half houses, half tiny little farm plots of rice or fruit. When I reach the house, I have a little trouble figuring out which side of the house is the front so I can find the key box.

As I’m looking for the key, a young couple drives up in a small car. The husband gets out, and says something about a house rental — so I guess this is the owner? But he says something that makes it sound like he thinks _I_ am the owner. Eventually we work out that we both happen to be renting houses that are right next to each other.

I chat with the couple a bit. They say that two other couples are coming soon, and will be spending the night in the house next to mine. All three couples have small infants. They’ll be barbecuing outside, so I say I’ll come say hello later.

Finally finding the key box, I let myself into the house. It’s a traditional house that’s been extensively remodeled. It’s kept one old-style feature: a set of stairs to the second floor that are so steep it feels like climbing a ladder. One side of the stairs is open to the main room, and there’s no handrail on the wall side either. To top it off, climbing the steep stairs excerises exactly whichever of my leg muscles are the sorest. For the rest of the day, I have to plan out my trips between the floors to minimize the number of times I must slowly and carefully crawl up or down the stairs.

The young woman from next door had recommended trying the local peaches, and suggested buying some at a supermarket. I decide to see if I can get something from a supermarket to make for dinner, and happily there’s one that’s just a few minutes walk away — I really don’t want to walk any more today. On the way, I happen to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji poking out over a nearby ridge. It seems very far away, and it feels impossible that I was standing on top of it just yesterday morning.

As hoped, the supermarket does have peaches in stock, along with some things I can heat in the house’s microwave for dinner. I prepare the dinner at home, which large turns out okay. I do have one failure: I’d bought what looked like a package of cucumber pickles, but it turns out to contain seasoning so that one can make their own pickles at home.

The packge of peaches I bought contains too many for me to eat, so I take some to the families having their barbecue next door. The woman I spoke with earlier is happy to take them, and she and her husband introduce me to the other couples. They offer me a drink, and I sit with them as they variously take turns disappearing into the house to get their infants ready for bed, or coming back out to eat a bit.

I speak for the longest time with a woman named Hana and a man named Masu. Hana’s daughter, Kiho, gnaws all the corn kernels off a bit of cob for a long time. Hana swaps the cob out for another, and Kiho enthusiastically gnaws on that one for a long time too. Kiho’s enough of a handful that it’s hard for Hana to get anything to eat, so I offer to hold Kiho for a bit. Hana is happy to accept the help, but she says that Kiho will probably cry. I use a trick Angela and I learned from a Christmas photo Santa years ago: I keep Kiho facing her mom as I take her and settle her on my lap. Hana and some of the other people laugh when they see that Kiho stays quiet.

Finally the party wraps up and we all head to bed.
