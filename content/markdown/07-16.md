I feel much better after a really long rest, but my legs are still sore. Today is my first day off from hiking, and it’s a deep relief to not have to walk anywhere today. It’s also scorching hot again, so I’m doubly grateful to be have this air-conditioned house to spend the day in.

In the middle of the morning, I walk to a nearby cafe called Cafe Amis for coffee. It’s tiny, with just four counter seats, tended by an older man. He seems to take his coffee seriously —- there’s a small coffee roasting machine in the corner of the cafe that he uses to roast the beans himself. He goes through a practiced routine with a small but immaculately-kept espresso machine. The resulting latte is, unsurprisingly, really good.

We get to chatting, and he’s interested in hearing about my hike. When I mention my climb over Mt. Fuji, he talks about the two times he climbed Fuji himself. Once it was too stormy to reach the summit, but he was successful the second time. We both agree that it’s not a particularly fun mountain to climb.

I spend most of the day inside sheltering from the oppressive 92°F heat, writing in my journal, and catching up on email. At lunchtime, I make a short walk outside to the closest restaurant, which turns out to make pretty good gyoza dumplings. And at dinnertime I find an Indian restaurant I can reach by bus, then have them call me a taxi to get back.
