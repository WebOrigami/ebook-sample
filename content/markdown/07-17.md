Today’s going to be another long day, and very hot as well, so I’m up early again. Before leaving Minami Alps City, I stock up at a Family Mart, and grab some ibuprofen at a pharmacy, and then head to the Minami Alps mountains west of town.

As forecast, the weather is extremely hot: about 90°F (32°C) and very humid. I keep drinking sports drinks to stay hydrated, but even with that it’s hard to keep up a good walking pace.

By the time I reach my intended destination for lunch, I’m giving serious thought to whether the afternoon’s hiking is going to be too much in the heat. I want to avoid heat stroke and so may have to skip the next section of road by taking a bus to the trailhead. I resolve to wait until after lunch to make a decision.

The restaurant doesn’t open for a few more minutes, and there’s a public toilet across the street, so I go in and douse my head and arms with cold water — that feels great, and definitely helps.

The restaurant opens on schedule. They only have a few options for lunch: cold soba noodles with “beef something” or with “chicken something”. I go for the chicken. The “something” word turns out to be “offal”. I do not enjoy it.

Still, I feel better after spending time in the cold restaurant. I still have several miles of twisty mountain road to climb, but I can see that there’s some kind of visitor center a mile and a half ahead. I figure that, if I can make it there, I can cool down there again, and so break up the hot roadwalk.

This plan works out even better than I’d hoped. I’m hot when I get to the visitor center in the Ashiyasu Hot Spring area — but notice that across the street there’s a basic hotel with a hot spring bath. There’s a sign outside that says “Day Bathing”, which means I can pay a small fee to use the bathhouse. A shower and a soak in the outdoor bath are _amazing_. I’ll get hot and sweaty again, but now I’m pretty sure I can finish the road-walking and reach the trailhead.

The remaining road is actually surprisingly pleasant: it’s just one lane, so the occasional cars are driving slowly. And one benefit of the road hugging the steep mountainside is that one side of the road is often in the shade.

The trailhead itself has a little lodge with an air-conditioned restaurant selling food, so I get a soft-serve ice cream and cool down once again.

Now I can finally get out my hiking poles and begin the actual hiking part of the day. It’s nice to be on a regular forest trail again. That said, the trail is _steep_. The trail up Mt. Si near Seattle is considered pretty steep, but this trail is roughly twice as steep.

I meet a few day hikers on their way back to the trailhead, along with two rock climbers. I later learn that the rock climbers had actually been scaling a waterfall in order to scope it out for ice climbing in winter.

I finally reach Yashajin Pass, and a few minutes later come to Yashajin Pass Lodge, a hut where I’m going to spend the night. The very nice hut host checks me in — and then explains that, while the past weekend had seen a packed house, tonight I’m going to be the only lodger.

That’s too bad, because I’d hoped to meet and chat with people over dinner. As it turns out, the host is happy to sit with me after serving dinner. He’s cooked a feast, far beyond the curry rice I was expecting. He’s even sliced up a huge local peach for dessert.

As we chat, I learn that his father was the previous hut host for many years before his knees got weak. The son (maybe in his late 20s?) has taken over management of the hut for the past five years. I’m surprised to hear that he has to personally carry all the food for the hut up the steep trail himself. They can bring in a helicopter for big things, but otherwise he brings up everything on his back.

“Well”, I tell him, “this peach is delicious. But I can’t believe you had to carry this heavy thing all the way up here!” He laughs, and we agree that it would be better if Yamanashi Prefecture were famous for some kind of food that’s lighter.
