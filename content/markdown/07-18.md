Breakfast is served early in these mountain huts, so I’m up at 5:00 and breakfast is at 5:15. The hut manager has cooked a fairly elaborate breakfast, so it actually takes me a while to eat everything. The skies are clear, so there are great views across the valley to the opposite range of peaks.

I’m out the door by 6:20, and the trail is instantly steep and hard. It stays that way for hours. On the plus side, the trail is shaded. By 8:00 am or so, fog rolls in, further cooling things down. The trail is quite popular, so even though it’s a weekday, I see hikers every 20 minutes or so.

The trail follows a ridge going north. There are several major peaks, and a number of smaller ones, all of which are marked with little monuments. At one of these monuments, I meet up with a man who’s talking with two women. The man is very chatty, and just keeps talking.

I meet up with the chatty guy again at another monument, where he’s chatting with another man. The two are watching a pair of deer, the first I’ve seen on this hike. Chatty man leaves the monument at the same time I do, so we end up hiking together for a while. As we go, he happily talks at length about the weather factors that frequently lead to afternoon rain, or about why Japan’s covid response was too slow.

I leave chatty man behind at one point, but then he passes me when I stop for a break. When I get to the top of Mount Yakushidake, he’s gotten as far as he’s going today. He’s stopped to celebrate with a beer, which he’s poured into a tall glass beer stein that he’s brought for the occasion. I ask about the glass, and he says it doesn’t feel festive enough to drink beer from a can.

I continue along the ridge to Mount Kannondake. On the way down from the peak, I meet another guy who’s very happy to talk with me.

My destination tonight is Phoenix Hut. I’d been told by several people that it takes 8–9 hours to cover the distance to the hut, and it’s necessary to check in by 4:00 pm if you want dinner. The difficulty of the trail is such that it does take much longer than I would have expected to cover the distance, but I’m still happy to get to the hut in 6.5 hours.

The hut’s apparently pretty popular, although it’s quite rustic. It is by a river, so one thing it has in abundance is water. There’s an old man there said to have lived at the hut for most of his life, but it seems that these days it’s most actively cared for by a young couple.

I take a nap, and as I rest I can hear more and more hikers coming in and being assigned places to sleep in the main house. I also can hear two boys laughing and antagonizing each other in English. After my nap I meet their parents: a man named Jan (like me!) and his wife Michiko. The boys, Kai and Wyn, are maybe 12 and 10. The family arrived at the hut yesterday and went for a day hike today; I passed them on Mount Kannondake.

Kai goes to sleep and never reappears, but I hang out with the rest of the family on a terrace over the river until dinner. They’re from a town in British Columbia not far from Kelowna.

We watch the antics of a good-natured older Japanese man who announces, “I had too much to drink!”, as he staggers around. It’s a little unnerving to watch him try to negotiate the steep stairs inside the hut.

Dinner’s on the early side at 5:30: curry rice served in a small eating hall. Everyone must be tired, because it’s fairly quiet and people are mostly focused on just eating. After dinner, most people go to straight to bed; some of them are going to try to summit Mount Jizodake before sunrise.

I stay up comparatively late, until the hut’s electricity is cut off at 8:00 pm. The hut’s futons are uncomfortably thin, but I follow the other Jan’s advice and fold the bottom futon in half to make a narrow but somewhat less uncomfortable bed.
