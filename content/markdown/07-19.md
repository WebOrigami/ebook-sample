The hut serves breakfast at 5:30 am, and once again it’s a quiet affair. I say my goodbyes to Jan and Michiko, then head down the trail for the trailhead and my next town. After passing one man, it becomes apparent that I’m the first person down this particular trail this morning — I spend several hours hitting countless spider webs until I meet the first hiker coming up from the bottom.

It’s hard to describe just how steep these trails are. The mountains themselves are extremely steep; from a distance some look like green walls. American trails almost always incorporate switchbacks to make climbing and descending easier (particularly for horses and other pack animals), but the trails I’m hiking here tend to go straight up and down. There are many roots and rocks, so the result is a kind of rough staircase where each step has to be considered to avoid turning an ankle.

There are occasional short sections of American trails like this, but the trails in the Japan Alps are like this _most of the time_. This morning’s trail from the hut to the trailhead is incredibly difficult just going down. There are a few brief sections where the trail is comfortable, and then the hard stairs resume. It’s like that for all three hours it takes me to reach the trailhead.

There’s supposed to be an inn at the trailhead, and I was hoping to stop in for some refreshment, but it’s pretty run-down. I purchase a can of orange soda from the proprietress, who chats for a bit and wishes me well on my walking.

I set out on the old single-lane road, and am a little dismayed to see that it doesn’t head down to town right away — it climbs up to a mountain pass before finally descending. I eventually enter the outskirts of the town of Hokuto, but sadly there aren’t many options for lunch.

I do manage to find one place that’s open, a cafe called Sanpomichi, and it’s charming. One of today’s specials is a cold “udon salad”, which is a perfect meal on a hot day.

I continue walking after lunch through the town, which seems to be mostly small farms. My room tonight is at a pension called Hanahakushu. When I get there, I ring the bell and no one answers. I call the number and say that I’m outside, and it turns out the pension is actually somewhere behind the house I’m in front of. I wait by the pension’s sign until the husband of the couple that owns the pension comes out and retrieves me.

The husband seems nice but a little fussy about things; his wife is much friendlier. After a bath and a nap, I read in the screen-in patio that looks out over their lush garden. At dinnertime, the wife sets out a huge spread: fried chicken and meatloaf and cold noodles and eggplant and little omelettes and there’s more. I tell her I’ll do my best. It’s all pretty good, but I can’t eat more than half of it.

Towards the end of the meal, the wife comes back and chats for a bit. She’s a fairly active person: she’s hiked several of the places I’m going, and she’s also an avid skier. She says they close the pension in the winter, partly because there aren’t as many visitors, but also so that she can have more time for skiing.
