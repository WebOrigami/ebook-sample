It’s much cooler in the early morning, so I sit out in the pension’s beautiful garden and read before breakfast. When I’m ready to check out, the husband asks where I’m going today, and I give him the name of the hotel where I’m heading: Yatsugatake Hotel Fuuka. This is just across a wide valley; today’s rural working will be among the shortest of the trip. “That’s not too far”, the man confirms, “but you’ll be going uphill all day.”

At least it’s not oppressively hot yet, and for the first mile or so I can walk on a sidewalk. These rural roads usually don’t have a sidewalk, and I end up walking on the right side of the road so I can at least see the oncoming traffic. (People drive on the left side in the Japan.) I’m always happy when there’s a sidewalk because I can relax a bit more.

In the middle of the morning, I see another loop in the walking directions. Last time it was a spiral tunnel inside a mountain; this time it’s a soaring ramp that loops high over itself.

By lunchtime I’ve reached the small town of Kobuchisawa. I’d hoped the town would have more lunch options near the train station, but there aren’t many. I aim for a basic Japanese restaurant — but as I’m getting close I notice a French flag hanging on a small storefront. It’s a French bistro called Bugaboo, which had looked great online but Google had said it would be closed for lunch.

To my delight, Google’s wrong, and the restaurant is open. Lunch is fantastic: a carrot soup to start, then a duck confit with cassoulet. I’m the first customer today, but shortly after I start to eat, a group of five Japanese women come in. One of them is deaf, and she and a speaking friend of hers sign to each other in Japanese Sign Language, which is different than American Sign Language.

By now it is really hot, so the short couple of miles from the restaurant to the hotel are slow. This area seems somewhat upscale: country pensions and hotels catering to well-dressed patrons. My hotel turns out to be just okay — it looked better online — but I’m happy that I’ve got a day off tomorrow.

After a visit to the bath, I take a cab to a nearby museum I’d discovered while looking into the area: a museum dedicated to the work of American artists Keith Haring. The museum’s not huge, but to my untrained eye does a good job laying out Haring’s life and work.

Dinner at the hotel is a course menu that is unremarkable.
