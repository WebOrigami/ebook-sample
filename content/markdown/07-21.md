A rest day! I spend the morning catching up on email and taking care of things. I hang out for a while on hotel’s back terrace. The hotel's backyard has a pen in which they keep three goats. One of the goats has escaped and is enjoying the terrace with me.

Our friend Hiroko happens to be spending the summer at her parent’s house in Nagano Prefecture, about an hour’s drive from here. My route won’t take me very close to them, but happily Hiroko and her father drive to my hotel to pick me up for lunch.

Yesterday I’d passed a stylish-looking cafe, so we try that for lunch. A sign outside says there’s a wait, but Hiroko inquires, and they can actualy seat us right away. The cafe focuses on vegetarian (or vegan?) cuisine made from local produce, and the food is delicious.

It’s great to catch up with Hiroko, and also to spend time with her father. Like Hiroko, both her parents are wonderfully kind people. We talk about my hike, but also share how our respective families are doing.

Before returning me to the hotel, they take me to a nearby Lawson’s convenience store so I can stock up on snacks for the next section of the hike.

I spend the rest of the day making more preparations, including a closer look at some of the harder hiking days. I’m learning that, due to the severe changes in elevation, my pace on these trails can be much slower than on trails back home. There are two upcoming days that had seemed plausible before the trip, but now look daunting. I’ll probably need to come with alternative plans for both of those days.
