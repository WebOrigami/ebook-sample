Today starts with a modest road walk to a trailhead to meet some friends. After climbing a bit, I switch to a road that’s traversing a slope, so for the first time in a while I have a long, easy, flat section.

I’m walking around the base of the Yatsugatake mountain range. People must come here for outdoor activities, because there are campgrounds, golf courses, and wintertime ski areas. There are also lots of country villas. I pass the first joggers I’ve seen on this trip, as well as a number of cyclists. At some point in the morning, I cross into Nagano Prefecture.

I stop for breakfast at Hamamura Cafe, a small, upscale place that’s playing Enya. It advertises itself as dog-friendly — there are plenty of dogs outside, and the cafe itself has some chihuahuas inside. I enjoy a breakfast of fluffy french toast.

I reach the Minato trailhead parking area, and wait on the deck of a lodge. A sequence of big hiking groups arrive, and they’re all making preparations to leave. One big group of adults is doing group stretches to limber up.

A short while later, my friends Mari and Sosuke arrive, along with Mari’s friends Erika and Itsuko. The four of them will join me hiking for the rest of the day and a bit of tomorrow morning. The first hour of our walk is on a dirt road that climbs up to the trailhead proper. From there, we climb up and up to reach Akadake Kosen. It’s called a mountain hut, but it’s a huge sprawling complex, more like a very rustic hotel than hut.

Mari and company have brought tents, so they set up about trying to find spots for the tents outside. These huts tend to be in the only flat places in the mountains, so tent camping is limited to areas next to the huts. It’s quite crowded, with tents pitched next to each other. Erika and Itsuko manage to find two spots that are relatively flat, but Mari and Sosuke end up on a distinct slope.

I visit the hut’s small attached bathhouse to rinse off, and after everyone else has set up their tents, we hang out over beers on a terrace. Amazingly, the hut has draft beer on tap, and Sosuke gets a beer for himself and one for me. A glass comes at a steep price of ¥1000 (maybe twice the usual price?). When Mari sits down, she bumps Sosuke’s beer. “Ah! There goes my 1000 yen beer!”

As the afternoon wears on, Mari and everyone get out the cooking gear and food and begin making their dinner. Mari and Sosuke have decided to make something other than curry rice. It involves rice, tomato paste, shiso leaves, and some other things. Everyone tries it and agrees it’s just okay. In the end, they pull out packages of curry to go with it. Now it tastes good, but of course now they’ve made curry rice again.

My stay inside the hut comes with a steak dinner. It’s not amazing, but it is a treat to have something heavy like this while hiking. After I’ve eaten, I hang outside some more with everyone and then it’s time for bed. I’m staying in the hut’s "Big Room", which accommodates 20 people. This isn’t condusive to a great rest. I have extremely vigorous snorers on both my right and my left, and even with earplugs they’re pretty loud.
