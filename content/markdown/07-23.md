We all wake up around 5:00. I have the hut’s basic Japanese breakfast (rice, miso soup, fish, pickles) while everyone else eats outside. At some point after 6:00 we’re mostly ready to continue hiking. Mari, Sosuke, and Erika will join me for the first part of the day up to the summit of Mt. Io, but Itsuko has decided she’s had enough hiking. She’ll wait at the hut for her friends to come back down, then the four of them will hike all the way back out to the trailhead and head home.

The morning climb is what I’m finding is typical of these trails: an endless staircase of roots and rocks. One thing that’s a little different is that everything here is covered in moss; the area must get a lot of rain. We occasionally get nice views of Mt. Akadake looming overhead, or else down the valley. We eventually reach a saddle below Mt. Io and take some photos. Unfortunately, fog is rolling in and stealing the view.

We continue the short but steep section of trail to reach the summit of Mt. Io. As feared, the fog has produced a whiteout. Mari laughs, because she climbed Mt. Io once before and that time it was socked in as well. We rest for a bit over a snack, and then it’s time for me to go on and for them to head back, so we all say goodbye.

For the rest of the morning, I continue north towards Mt. Tengu. The trail occasionally skirts cliffs. I dislike heights, so I’m glad that the trail usually keeps some distance from the top of the cliffs. The rocky final climb to the summit of Mt. Tengu is nevertheless a little unnerving for me, so I’m happy when I reach the top.

From there it’s a long, slow descent to reach a forested plateau and a hut called Kuroyuri Hyutte. After the extravagance of a bathhouse and wifi last night, the Kuroyuri hut is decidedly basic. I arrive before noon — this is one of the shortest days on this trip. Originally, Mari and Sosuke had hoped to hike with me for another night, so we’d picked this hut to keep the day short. Their plans had to change, but I ended up sticking with the reservation, so I now I have a whole afternoon to hang out.

The hut only offers a few kinds of snacks, but for some reason one of them is frozen chocolate-covered bananas. The hut doesn’t have many amenities — but there’s a piano in the corner, as well as a full string bass. The piano must have been air-lifted, but a staffer says he brought the bass up himself. In the mid-afternoon, he picks up the bass and begins plucking out jazz riffs. Later another staffer produces a trumpet, and the two play together for a while.

I meet a nice group of hikers over dinner: Ayumi, Keiko, and Mari (another one). We have fun talking about the hiking in the area.

Later an older man comes over to hear more about my hike. The hike is definitely a great conversation opener. Everyone’s very surprised to hear I’m walking across the country. Older Japanese men are less impressed by the hike; they are more amazed that anyone could ever take a month off from work. (It’s very hard in Japan to take more than a week or so of vacation.)

Before bedtime, the string bass player helps me adjust my route for tomorrow. My original plan didn’t account for the difficulty of the trails here, so together we work out a more plausible route that trades several difficult mountain climbs for some road walking.

He asks if I can show him the gear I’m hiking with. I don’t have much interesting gear with me, but I show him what I have. He’s very excited to see that I’m hiking in trail runners made by a company called Altra — he happily shows me his own pair of Altras. I think he feels like I’ve validated his choice in trail shoes.

I’m going to be sleeping in a big communal room again tonight, so I brace myself for the elderly male snoring chorus. The only comfortable sleeping position on these thin futons is sleeping on one’s back, which makes the snoring that much worse. There’s a man two futons over from me with the loudest snores I’ve ever heard — every few minutes, zzzzzzSNORK! Even through the earplugs, it’s as loud as a shout.
