As I’m preparing to leave the hut, I find that someone else’s mobile phone has been left behind in the men’s bathroom. The hut staff manage to locate its owner before he leaves, and he’s grateful for the return of his phone.

Losing my phone is one of my biggest concerns. My shoes are probably the most critical item of gear for this hike, and my phone is the second most critical item. The third most critical item is my stack of ¥100 coins which are needed for the pay toilets.

I say goodbye to Ayumi, Keiko, and Mari, as well as the nice old man who spoke with me last night. My first destination for the day is the summit of Nakayama, followed by a descent to Shirakoma Pond. I hadn’t originally planned to go past the pond, but the hut staffer last night recommended this route as faster, and I’m glad I’ve come this way — there aren’t many alpine lakes in this area, so the pond is a pretty sight.

This part of the Yatstugatake range is famous for its mosses — something like 800 species of mosses are found here. This forest has its own little mossy mascot named Kokemaru. He’s cute, and I enjoy looking for him on the trail signage in the area.

I make a short detour to a trailhead in hopes of finding some refreshment, and am not disappointed. The small shop there sells juice from a local berry that in Japanese is called “kokemomo” and turns out to be lingonberry.

The next section of trail is somewhat unusual for the area, crossing some bushy alpine meadows. I eventually reach a long boardwalk that makes its way towards the top of a large gondola. I’m crossing my fingers that the gondola is operating, because that implies the existence of a restaurant selling food to tourists coming up the mountain. When I first spot the gondola’s top station, it looks like it’s not operating, but I eventually hear the sound of a giant motor spinning up. Yay! The expected tourist restaurant is there, serving (no surprise) curry rice for lunch.

I descend a trail that runs below the gondola down to the base station. There’s another, bigger tourist complex there, where I get some kokemomo/lingonberry soft serve ice cream.

From here, I’ll be walking on roads for the rest of the afternoon, mostly along a popular mountain sightseeing route called the Venus Line. This road might be the nicest rural route I’ve walked on so far — aside from the promised views, the road climbs at a steady, gentle slope that lets me move quickly without getting exhausted. I crest a mountain pass, then the road descends at the same gentle slope. I pass a long group of cyclists pumping their way towards the pass — a race of some kind?

I eventually reach Lake Shirakaba, where I’m going to spend the night. The east end of the lake is dominated by the Ikenotaira Resort, which is teeming with vacationers. I stop at a Lawson convenience store to stock up on snacks again. It’s pretty hot now, so I buy some kind of orange juice to drink outside the store. Bleah — it’s juice blended with saké, which isn’t what I’m looking for to rehydrate.

I walk a short distance along the lake to a small pension called Little Grebe. After a couple of nights in mountain huts, it feels great to have a bath, a good meal, and a rest on a real bed in a quiet room.
