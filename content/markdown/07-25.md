After breakfast at the pension, I start walking around Lake Shirakaba. I stop a short while later for coffee at another cafe that roasts its own beans.

I begin climbing Mt. Kuruma, which is striking because instead of forest, it’s covered with grass. This change in environment is fun, and the views are great. On the other hand, it’s hot.

I aim for a cafe about halfway up the mountain, but when I reach it, I find that it’s closed today. I walk a little farther and stop at a trail junction to eat a lunch of snacks from Lawson.

While I’m eating, an older man stops me to ask where I’m from. When I say America, he asks from where in America. When I say Seattle, he reacts the same way most older people do: “Oh, Seattle — The Mariners! Ichiro!

After my light lunch, I hike for ten minutes before realizing that I’d picked the wrong trail back at the junction. Rather than backtrack, I’ll keep going and then make my way down to the right trail. Serendipitously, this wrong trail leads to a hillside hut called Korobokkuru Hutte. It has a charming cafe — and it’s open! I have a second lunch of 3-inch thick buttered toast with strawberry jam and iced cafe au lait.

This area’s pretty popular with hikers who, in addition to the beautiful sweeping views, have come to see a particular flower called nikko kisuge, a kind of day lily. Our friends Satoru and Hiroko brought us to this area — maybe this spot? — many years ago to see the flowers, and it’s nice to see them again.

I descend a steep trail to a river, then pick up a beautiful shaded boardwalk that skirts the edges of the grassy Yashimagahara Marshlands. This bit of walking is, so far, the most pleasant and scenic of the trip so far (and maybe of the whole trip).

Tonight’s lodgings are at Washigamine Hut, a self-described “hermitage” near the edge of the marshlands. I’m a little early, so they make me wait out in the garden. The man who owns it eventually brings me inside to check in. For the first time on the trip, the check-in process includes a covid questionnaire — it’s a little unnerving to read it while he watches and make sure I’m answering the Yes/No questions correctly.

When I’d first filled out the online reservation form, this man had answered, “We almost never have foreign visitors. We can’t speak English. I’m very worried.” I’d reassured him that everything would be fine. I do my best to pay attention as he shows me the place to make sure I understand the many house rules.
