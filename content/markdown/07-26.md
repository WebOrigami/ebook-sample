Today’s the second of three days I’ve had to replan to account for the insanely hard — and time-consuming — nature of the trails in the Japan Alps. In this case, instead of taking trails over several mountains, I’m going to walk on roads and go around the mountains.

Google Maps proposes two walking routes: 21 miles (34 km) mostly on twisty mountain roads, or 22 miles (35.4 km) mostly on regular rural and urban roads. Although I really don’t want to walk more than necessary, I opt for the 22-mile route so that I’ll have places to eat and cool off. It’s hot again, of course.

The first few miles are on a road that winds its way down a steep hillside through a forest. It’s well-shaded, and it’s still early, so this part of the day is thankfully cool.

After reaching the first little settlement, there’s a brief bit of walking I do on an old Japanese trail called the Nakasendo. This used to be one of the primary means of traveling to Tokyo and back. I hiked a little bit of this trail with my daughters Liya and Bree in 2018. Today the little section I’m walking isn’t particularly trail-like, but it’s still nice to walk a bit of the trail.

Sadly, a little later the walking route shifts on to the side of a highway, and then comes to the entrance of the 1.2 mile (2 km) Kohoku Tunnel. As with all the other tunnels, this one thankfully has a sidewalk on both sides, but it’s still a freakishly long way to walk beside a busy road in dim light. The trucks speeding through the tunnel create gusty winds.

I stop in the town of Okaya to eat a lunch of gyoza and to enjoy some air conditioning. After lunch, there’s another section of the Nakasendo trail to walk. This one goes up steeply to a mountain pass that has a little shrine at the top.

Coming down from the pass, I’m getting close to the city of Matsumoto where I’m going to spend the next two days. Unfortunately, for many miles the walking route is on a frontage road next to a huge expressway.

There’s a lot of noise from the expressway, but what’s worse is that the frontage road itself is fairly busy. The narrow shoulder to walk on is completely overgrown with bushes in some sections, and in those places I have to wait for traffic to clear out before I can hustle past the bushes.

I walk for hours in this way past rice paddies. I’m very happy when I finally reach the city outskirts and the first 7-11 convenience store so I can take another cool-down break.

After about 8 hours of walking in the heat with occasional breaks, I finally reach the Hotel Buena Vista and can check in. My feet ache from walking on pavement for so long. After a shower, I find the closest Italian restaurant that looks like it serves a decent margherita pizza and slowly walk there for dinner.
