Today’s a day off from walking, but I’m up early so I take care of laundry. The hotel laundry machines combine a washer and dryer into a single unit that also automatically injects detergent.

Japanese cafes tend to open late in the morning, but there’s one near my hotel that’s open early and it has decent coffee and cinnamon toast. After taking care of some things back at the hotel, I head out again and stop by a cute street called Niwate Dori. The street includes a small shrine to frogs. The river next to the street used to be home to lots of frogs, but years ago a flood wiped them out. Local residents build a shrine in honor of the frogs.

I now have to do an errand at a Lawson convenience store, which I enter with some trepidation. Back in May, I’d purchased tickets for the new Ghibli Park area near Nagoya for me, Angela, Liya, and Bree. Getting the tickets was next to impossible: the site intended for international visitors would make me wait in a virtual “line” for an hour for the privilege of buying tickets — and then crash. After this happened multiple times, I gave up and used the site for residents of Japan.

In theory, I should be able to pick up the tickets at a ticket kiosk at any Lawson, but I’m not sure if it’s actually going to work or whether it might put up more hurdles. I walk up to a ticket kiosk, punch through several screens, and miraculously the kiosk produces a slip of paper I can hand to the cashier, who prints out the tickets for me.

I get a late morning snack, then walk to Matsumoto Castle. It’s a beautiful stone and wooden building. That said, it’s very hot out today, so the inside of the castle is stifling. Leaving the castle grounds, I see some people getting out of a taxi and manage to flag it so I can avoid more walking in the sun.

In the afternoon I go to a movie theater to catch a showing of “The Boy and the Heron”. This is probably going to be the last movie drawn and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, so I’m happy to be able to see it in a theater.

Back at the hotel, I’m taking care of more things when there’s a thunderstorm. On long hikes, it’s delightful when a storm happens when I happen to be inside somewhere.

At dinnertime, I see that there’s a well-reviewed Chinese restaurant very close by, so leave the hotel in search of it. My phone’s map keeps twisting around and “Recalculating” the route. I eventually work out that the restaurant is _inside my hotel_.
