I follow the Narai River out of Matsumoto City, but then the route shifts to follow a busy highway I have to stay on for the rest of the morning.

It’s 92°F and humid, so I’m drenched by the time I reach the town of Toyoshina and a little Italian cafe called Bambi just as its opening for lunch. I order a pasta bolognese, and am surprised when it comes with a rather large plate of appetizers and a cold dessert as well.

After lunch, my route heads through rice farms, which if anything are even hotter than the highway. I have to keep stopping in the tiny bits of shade I can find under trees near homes.

There’s exactly one little cafe, Cafe Bonbonsha, that lies along my afternoon route, and I’m so happy it’s open. I drink a housemade lemonade and wait to cool off before moving on.

The route now begins to climb up into the foothills of the Northern Alps range. The grade isn’t too bad, so I keep up a good pace. I eventually reach the edge of a huge golf course. I’m surprised when I see a monkey walking across the road in front of me. I’d known these mountains had monkeys, but didn’t expect to see one today. The monkey cuts across the road and heads into the country club parking lot.

I reach today’s destination, Hotel Ambient Azumino, which I’d picked because it was the furthest into the hills and so closest to a trailhead. It’s a little run-down, but even an old Japanese hotel will still have a nice bathhouse.

I discover that I left my reading glasses back at the Bambi restaurant where I'd stopped for lunch. I call them and they graciously agree to mail the reading glasses to a hotel I'll stop at in a couple of days.
