I’ve been wrestling with what to do with the last week of my walk across Japan. The trail portions are taking longer than expected, and I can see there are a couple of days that looked fine in theory would be physically impossible. I’ve also discovered that the last day of the walking route proposed by Google Maps includes a 3.5 mile / 5.7 km long tunnel. Unlike all the other tunnels I’ve passed through so far, this one does not include a sidewalk. No thank you! So I also need to come up with a new route that avoids the tunnel.

This morning I walk out of the hotel and head towards the Ichinosawa Trailhead. At the beginning, I’m passing country villas, but eventually there’s nothing but the road winding along a steep green hillside. Occasionally taxis pass me taking hikers to the trailhead. At the trailhead there’s a small building. Two taxi drivers are chatting under the building’s awning, passing the time as they wait for some hikers to arrive that need a ride back to town.

The trail is short (less than 3 miles) but climbs steeply (over 3500 feet) to a ridge where tonight’s hut lies. The trail follows a river that tumbles down over rocks. This river is fed by countless streams. This is a change from the mountain trails I’ve hiked on this trip until now; none of them had many stream crossings. There are lots of other hikers on this trail, although everyone I see is coming down — perhaps everyone else heading up must have arrived much earlier than I did.

I come to a place where a kind of flow of rocks has come down the mountain. Other hikers have stopped here to rest, so I decide to stop and have an early lunch myself. It’s too much trouble to carry a real lunch, so I just keep eating snacks until I don’t feel hungry.

The trail gets steeper and steeper as it approaches the ridge. At one point, I see a rope alongside an extremely steep and sandy channel that looks precarious. When I reach that point, I’m enormously relieved to see an “×” mark indicating that the sketchy slope is not the trail (or, at least, is no longer the official trail). In the other direction, there’s a “○” mark indicating that the correct route is up a series of steep stairs. In between the stairs, the trail occasionally skirts the top of a big drop; I hustle past without looking down.

I reach a point where the trail is going to divert away from the river, so take the opportunity to take of my shoes and shirt and rinse off as best as I can — the hut won’t have any shower. There’s a young couple at the spot, and they’re taking turns dunking their heads in the river. They’re the only other people I’ve seen this entire trip that are cooling themselves off like that. After they leave, a group of older men comes down. One of the trips, falls, and bangs himself up a bit. He eventually dusts himself off, but seeing him fall is a reminder that these rocky trails really are treacherous, and it wouldn’t take much to receive an incapacitating injury.

After the river, there are more steep stairs and cliffy bits. The trail keeps getting steeper. When I’m less than a mile from tonight’s hut, I still have 2000 feet of elevation to climb! I meet two men who tell me that they’ve seen a bear and that I should take care. I’m skeptical of this claim — there are so many hikers making so much noise, I can’t imagine a bear hanging out near this trail. But for a while I add “bears on cliffs” to my list of things to worry about.

I reach the hut, Jonen Goya, at 2:00 pm. The hut is large, and absolutely hopping with people; it’s a hiker party. I get checked in, then go get a snack from the little kitchen: yakionigiri (grilled rice ball) and a draft beer. I sit down in the dining area at a table with two men who are a little older than I am. We get to talking, and they’re fascinated to hear about my hike.

Once again I’ve been assigned to the big general sleeping area. This one’s in an attic space under the roof on the hut’s third floor. The space is divided into individual sleeping areas by small plastic partitions. One of the two men tell me that the partitions were only introduced during the covid pandemic. Before then, they used to pack twice as many futons into the same space.

The Men’s Snoring Chorus isn’t too bad tonight, although there’s one guy whose snores sound like a tiger growling. There are also many “Let’s see the sunrise from the summit!” groups that get up and bang around between 2:00–4:00 am.
