I have breakfast with my two new friends from yesterday afternoon. It’s a beautiful morning, with amazing views of a long ridge of peaks that includes the very pointy Yarigatake (“Mount Spear”).

It takes a bit of time to pack up, but I’m out of the hut around 5:30 am. The first objective of the day is to climb up and over neighboring Mount Jonen. The summit is only about 1000 feet higher than the saddle where the hut is, but it’s still a rocky, tiring climb. Along the way I meet the two men again; they’re already on their way back down, so we bid each other farewell.

The very top of Mount Jonen gets slightly steep, but I’m relieved there are no big drop-offs that would bother me. It’s nice to rest at the top for a bit and chat with other hikers. I talk with a European couple who spent last night at the same hut. They describe themselves as nomads who were trapped in Japan during the pandemic. They’re hiking a bunch of peaks in these Northern Alps before moving next month to San Francisco.

Although there was nothing on the way up to trigger my unease with heights, it turns out the way _down_ on the other side requires traversing a short ridge with steep drop-offs on both sides. I try not to look as I hustle across.

I’m going to spend the rest of the morning hiking along a ridge — but the ridge itself isn’t particularly flat. In fact, it contains a number of steep descents and ascents to various peaks along the ridge. At the top of one of these peaks, Mount Choyari, I meet and talk with a group of young day hikers who live in the town of Azumino I passed through two days ago. They ask me where I’m headed today, and I say that I’m going along the ridge, then down into the valley to the west, then a long way down the valley to a popular area called Kamikochi.

“Oh, that’s pretty far”, they say.

“Yes”, I reply, “it’s too far.”

One of them says, “You have regrets.”

“Yes”, I say.

I reach the top of yet another peak, Mount Chogatake, where there’s a nice mountain hut. I have a lunch of curry cup noodles and a cafe au lait. The coffee tastes so good, I get a second one.

From there it’s a long, long way down an endless staircase of rocks and tree roots to the valley floor. I’m getting close to the bottom when I meet a trio of Americans heading up the trail. They’re aiming for the hut where I had lunch, but I don’t think they have a good sense of how many more hours they’re going to be hiking up. It’s unclear whether they’ll make it in time for dinner.

At the bottom of the descending trail there’s a large campground and inn, where I stop for a drink and a soft-serve ice cream. There are tons of people, but surprisingly, all of them have walked to get here. This inn is served by a road that’s not open to the general public, so everyone’s had to walk up the valley to reach this point. As I walk down along the main valley floor trail towards my hotel, I pass many, many people, and everyone of them is carrying some kind of pack. It’s hard to think of an area this popular in the U.S. that’s only accessible by walking.

The Azusa River that flows down the valley is really quite pretty: it’s wide and very clear. Combined with the steep, picturesque mountain ridges on both sides of the valley, I can see why this area is so popular.

I eventually reach the Kappabashi Bridge, a nexus of hotels, shops, and restaurants. I cross the bridge, and a short while later reach my hotel.
