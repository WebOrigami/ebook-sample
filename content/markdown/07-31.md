This is a rest day from walking, and I spend much of it replanning the rest of the hike. My plan to hike through these mountains was too ambitious given the slow pace on the steep, challenging trails. It’s hard to let go of this plan, but there’s nothing for it. I make a long series of phone calls to cancel reservations and spend hours trying to find a new sequence of lodgings that are walking distance from each other.

I walk back to the Kappabashi Bridge area for lunch and to enjoy the scenery. There’s a wide, rocky part of the riverbed where people are wading out into the river a bit. I wade in, and quickly have to get back out — this pretty river is also painfully cold.
