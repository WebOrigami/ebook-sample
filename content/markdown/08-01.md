title: August 1 — Day 22

Because my mountain route was too ambitious, I’m going to return to the small town of Toyoshina I passed through a few days ago. I’ll resume walking from there, this time heading straight north, mostly on roads. That’s a more direct route to the coast, so I’ll still be able to finish my hike on schedule in a week.

I take a bus from the Kamikochi area back to Matsumoto City. The bus passes through many old tunnels, and I find myself focusing on how precarious it’d be to walk through them. The bus reaches a station in Shin-Shimashima, where everyone transfers to a train heading into the city.

Although it was still pretty warm in the mountains, it’s positively broiling in Matsumoto. I get pizza for lunch, then take another train to Toyoshina where I can resume walking. It’s funny to be back in the nondescript little town.

The afternoon’s walking route follows a busy road, the same sort of road you find on the outskirts of American towns with all the outlet stores and car dealerships. It’s not pleasant, but any other route would be significantly longer.

I’m crossing a bridge when I see an eagle trying to retrieve a dead fish from the side of a river. It’s mesmerizing to watch the eagle circle around in the wind, which has begun to pick up. As I’m watching, my eye catches a lightning flash far off in the mountains to the east. Rain is coming.

I hustle along in hopes of beating the rain, but eventually it catches me. The rain starts the way it always does in Miyazaki anime movies: a few drops, then a few more, and then a deluge.

The rain presents a new obstacle: I can’t use my phone. Modern phones are actually pretty waterproof, so the phone itself is fine. But it turns out that a wet phone can’t register touches. I’ve reached a point where I need to look at the next set of walking directions, but can’t even unlock my phone to see them. It’s hard to dry off the phone with anything, since everything I’m wearing is already soaked. It’s both frustrating and comical to be standing in the pouring rain, swiping and swiping in hopes of getting the phone to unlock. Eventually I’m able to unlock it, get directions, and keep walking. At some point the storm passes.

I reach the town of Shinano Matsukawa, my destination for the day. Unfortunately, there’s no hotel nearby, so today my plan is to take a train from this town to the closest town with a hotel, Shinano Omachi; I’ll come back here tomorrow and resume walking.

The train is running late, something that’s pretty unusual in Japan. The station has no staff, but a train employee somewhere else makes announcements over and over to apologize for the trouble. When the train finally comes and I get to Shinano Omachi Station, I need to pay my train fare before I can exit. All I have are ¥10,000 notes (about $70 today) from an ATM. I try to pay with one of those bills, which is damp from the rain — the station cashier says the bill is too wet for the machine to read it. This precipitates a two- or three-person search for a dry ¥10,000 yen note in the office that can be used to produce change. Eventually everything works out and I can leave.

I’m staying in a no-nonsense business hotel, which happily is just across the station plaza. After using the bathhouse and a nap, I head to dinner at a nearby Taiwanese restaurant. It’s run by a couple: a Japanese man and a Taiwanese woman. They squabble too much at each other but are nice to the customers. The man is watching the weather report, and complains that they haven’t been getting any rain lately. I mention that I was caught in a storm just south of here this afternoon, and the man’s surprised. Apparently recent rainstorms keep passing this town by, and it’s causing problems for the local farmers.
