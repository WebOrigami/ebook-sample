I start the day by taking the train back to Shinano Matsukawa so I can continue my line of footprints from the Pacific Ocean. I’ll be passing back through this town of Shinano Omachi, so before leaving I drop off my small backpack at the hotel’s front desk. This means I can walk for the morning without that weight.

Starting the walk at Shinano Matsukawa, I head for the nearby Takase River, figuring that the road along the river will be nicer than the busy road I walked all yesterday afternoon. It _is_ nice to have the river in view — but sadly the road along the river is also busy, and doesn’t have the benefit of a sidewalk. I give up and back to the same main road as yesterday so I can at least walk safely.

Today I keep passing farming cooperatives and light industrial buildings. In the middle of the morning, I come to a 7-11. I’ve learned that Japanese convenience stores sometimes have sad little “cafe” areas, which are generally just a couple of chairs by a little counter in the corner. I never see anyone sitting there — but they do serve as a place I can sit down and drink something cold in air-conditioned comfort.

I get back to Shinano Omachi and have lunch. I retrieve my backpack from the hotel. Before I leave, I ask the hotel clerk if there are any places to swim at Lake Kisaki, where I’m heading today. “Hmm, no place to swim,” she says, “but there’s a place you can suppu.” “What’s ‘suppu’, I ask?” “Um, it’s kind of like kayaking.” After leaving the hotel, I realize that Japanese had adopted a new verb from English: “suppu” means “paddleboard”, from the English “SUP” (Stand-Up Paddleboard).

Since my B&amp;B for tonight doesn’t allow check-in before 4:00 and I’m only an hour and a half away, I have some time to kill. I hang out in a cafe, then try visiting the local musuem to the Shio no Michi (literally, Salt Road), an important trading route between the northern coast and this area in pre-industrial times. I’ll be generally following the path of the Shio no Michi for the rest of the trip, so I stop by the museum. Sadly, it’s closed.

It’s cloudy this afternoon, so the weather is only very warm instead of the usual sweltering. When I get to Lake Kisaki, I still have more time to kill, so I find a “suppu” rental shop where I can rent a paddleboard. It’s a nice change of pace to paddle around the south end of the lake for an hour.

Tonight’s B&amp;B has a faux Bavarian exterior and is extremely basic inside, but the old woman who runs it is very nice. They only serve breakfast, so I have to walk a fair distance to get to the closest restaurant that appeals to me. It’s a decent restaurant in a cute house surrounded by rice paddies. Before I leave, the woman who’s running the front of the house hands me a little bag of snacks for my hike and wishes me well.

By the time I’m walking back to the B&amp;B, it’s getting dark. I’m relieved the front door is still open.
