The rather large B&amp;B had seemed like I was the only one in it last night, but in the morning I see at least two other men who spent the night.

The owner brings out a massive breakfast, easily four times what I’d normally eat; I can barely finish a third of it. She and I talk for a bit before I head out. I mention that I’d enjoyed sleeping with the window open last night, and she brightens up. “Oh, yes,” she says, “That’s so much better than sleeping with the air conditioning on. It’s often hot in the days now, so everyone who stays here keeps the A/C on all night, but the night’s are actually nice and cool.” She also confirms that my plan to walk up the west side of Lake Kisaki is correct; it’s the prettier side of the lake and has more shade.

The walk along Lake Kisaki is nice, but at the north end of the like I have to walk along a busy highway for a short while. I can get off the highway when I reach the south end of Lake Aoki, another pretty mountain lake. Again I go up the west side. This is not only the official route of the Shio no Michi walking trail — the map also shows a cafe called Bob’s Coffee halfway up the lake. Bob’s is open, and an iced latte is refreshing.

A short while later I come to a man photographing a large group of kids riding paddleboards on the lake. I chat with the man, and he explains that the kids are part of a week-long summer camp. It looks like they’re having fun.

The road after that becomes less-used and eventually turns to a gravel road through a thick forest. This stretch of the Shio no Michi is called Sanosaka Pass, and it’s easily the most beautiful bit of walking I’ve had since leaving the Northern Alps.

The gravel road leads to the base of some ski lifts. There’s a railroad crossing too, marked with a sign that warns, “Don’t cross the train tracks wearing skis!” There can't be many places in the world with such a sign.

I spend the rest of the morning and early afternoon walking along a river through rice fields. These fields constitute an ecosystem that often includes white cranes and gray herons. As I walk, occasionally a bird will lift up out of the rice plants and slowly flap off away from the trail.

I come to the outskirts of Hakuba, one of the towns that hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics. The town’s surrounded by ski slopes, and I can see the ski jump towers that were built for the Olympics. I have lunch at a small roadside restaurant, then walk in the afternoon heat to a cafe to wait until I can check into my hotel.

Hakuba is a cute ski town. I see more foreigners here than any other place on the trip so far.
