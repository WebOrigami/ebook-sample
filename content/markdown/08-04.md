I’d hoped to stay in Hakuba for another day, but my hotel doesn’t have a room for a second night. I decide to take what hikers call a “nero”: nearly zero, i.e., a very short day. In this case, I’m going to walk 5 miles to a pension at another ski area called Tsugaike.

Since I have most of the day free, I ride a gondola and a couple of ski lifts high up on a neighboring mountain. The lift operator has lowered the ski lifts so they’re only a little bit above the level of the mountain meadows they cross — my feet brush against the tops of the meadow plants. I then hike up to a popular scenic spot called Happo Pond. The pond is indeed pretty, although the low clouds steal much of the view.

I hike back down to the top of the highest lift and get a bite to eat. I share a table with a couple; the wife tells me she’s spent some time in California, but hasn’t been to Seattle yet.

Back at the base, I stop for shaved ice to cool off. The stand sits in front of a bike and ski shop owned by a Japanese woman and an Australian man. The woman chats with me in Japanese about my hike, then the man and I talk for a bit in English about his life in Hakuba. They seem quite happy living here.

By now it’s 2:00 pm, so I pick up my backpack from the hotel and walk the 5 miles to Tsugaike. This doesn’t take that long, but I’m soaked by the time I reach the area. At first I’m concerned that the walking directions seem to be leading me to a place that looks run down, but the pension I’m staying at is actually behind the run-down one. The pension is on the old side, but seems well cared-for by a couple that apparently have been running it for almost 50 years. The place doesn’t have air conditioning, so it’s warm inside.

The couple serves a dinner of a series of little courses, mostly French. Most of them are really, really good — this may be the best meal I’ve had on this trip. I tell this to the wife, and she seems quite embarrassed by the compliment.

After dinner I ask the husband about the course of the Shio no Michi from this point north — is it easy to follow? He says yes, and also gives me a better map of the route than the one I found online.

It’s pretty hot even after the sun’s gone down, so it takes a while to fall asleep.
