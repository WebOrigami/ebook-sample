The owners of the pension serve a nice breakfast, and the wife asks me a little bit about where I learned Japanese. They say it’s going to be hot again today (it’s been hot every day!) and tell me to take care.

Today’s the first day I’m trying to hike the actual route of the Shio no Michi trail as closely as I can. For the past few days, I’ve occasionally walked little pieces of it, but for the most part just took the most efficient walking route, even if that meant walking on busy roads. From this area of Tsugaike to the end in Itoigawa the trail is apparently quite nice in sections, so I’ll try to follow it the best I can.

It’s a little strange to walk without using my phone’s GPS for guidance, and rely entirely on trail signage. (I can’t find a downloadable route of the Shio no Michi trail online.) Happily, the trail has abundant sign posts and road markings. As long as I don’t miss a trail marker, I should be okay.

It’s only 8:30 am, but it’s already pretty hot. I’m happy when the trail enters a forest so I’m at least in the shade.

I follow the Shio no Michi through the morning, going into and out of little settlements. In the town of Otari I stop at one of the museums on the trail, this one dedicated to local history. I’m also surprised to see a number of new restroom stops that seem to have been created specifically for people walking the trail.

After walking through a small town called Kudarise, I come to the end of the main street and get the sense I’ve missed a trail marker. I double-check my location, and it looks like I’ve indeed missed a turn. I walk back for a bit, and eventually find a discreet trail marking on the street that I’d passed by without noticing it.

From there, the trail climbs steeply to a pass. I’ve just crossed over the pass when there’s an explosion of noise right in front of me. It’s a ptarmigan — something like a mountain chicken. They tend to sit on the ground, and their brown camouflage makes them very hard to see until you’re right on top of them. Just as I’m getting over the fright of the ptarmigan, a second one bursts out of the grass and scares me again.

When I come to the next set of houses, I check the map and realize I’ve entered a tiny town named Nakatsuchi. I’d actually intended to stop at the previous town in hopes of finding a “day bathing allowed” hot spring and a place to eat. Now I’ve gone too far. I walk to the small clump of buildings that serves as Nakatsuchi’s town center, but pretty much everything’s closed. There’s a man standing there, and he confirms that the closest hot spring is in the town I passed by a while ago.

I don’t want to go back there, so I pin my hopes on a small cafe called Cafe 13 Gatsu (“Month 13”) that’s about 30 minutes further. There’s nowhere else to eat in this area, so I’m hoping Google has it right when it says that the cafe is open.

To reach the cafe, I have to go through several tunnels, but there’s not a lot of traffic on this road, and the tunnels have a sidewalk (or a wide shoulder) so I don’t feel unsafe. To convey a sense of how steep the mountains in this area are: I emerge from one tunnel and come to a four-way intersection. Every one of the four directions leads to a tunnel.

I eventually see a sign for the cafe, which is promising. I finally see the cafe building high above the road. They have a little flag flapping out front with a red kanji for “ice” on a blue and white background. Restaurants fly this little flag to advertise that they serve shaved ice desserts. That’s very promising.

The cafe turns out to be charming. The main course for lunch today is a Sumatran curry which is both visually appealing and tasty. I follow this with an apricot shaved ice that hits the spot.

My lodgings tonight are at a _kominka_ (a large traditional Japanese country house) that’s now run as a guesthouse. This one has a bit of a commune vibe — guests are expected to help out with various tasks like preparing meals, setting a communal table, and cleaning up. Tonight there are nine other guests, two men and seven women, most of them in their 20s. There are two people in their 30s running the place: Yamaguchi-san (who goes by “Gussan” here) and Hitomi-san (“Hitchan”). Everyone’s very friendly.

The only big downsides of the traditional building are that: 1) it doesn’t have air conditioning, so it’s hot inside, and 2) it doesn’t have its own bath (at least not one for guests). Around 5:30, Gussan organizes a group trip to a nearby hot spring. Oddly, the hot spring is attached to a highway rest area, but it’s not bad. I’m happy I can finally rinse off.

Back at the guesthouse, Hitchan’s been making some preparations for a barbecue dinner. Everyone pitches in where they can. It’s dark by the time dinner is ready, and then it starts to rain. A tarp’s been set up over the eating area, but one side of it is loose, so I scramble out on a second-floor roof to help secure it.

Dinner’s a fun affair. Gussan has everyone give a short self-introduction. Unusually for Japan, all of the guests ask to be called by their first name or a nickname, which normally wouldn’t happen until everyone knew each other much better. There’s a variety of grilled meats and vegetables to eat, and it’s all pretty good.

I sit next to a woman named Natsuko who’s wearing a t-shirt that says “Mirth” on it. I ask her if she knows what the word means, and there follows a discussion about the meaning of “mirth”. Everyone’s focusing on her and her shirt, and she’s embarrassed by the attention.
