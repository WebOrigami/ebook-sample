The kominka guesthouse starts its day with a group breakfast. Most of the guests are staying there for another night, but I need to keep walking. When I’m getting ready to leave, everyone comes outside to see me off.

Today I’ll be hiking two more sections of the Shio no Michi trail. I’m a little worried about the first section, because I not only don’t have a GPS route to follow, but the section is remote. I have a paper map, but sometimes it’s a little hard to reconcile what it says with where I am. Just finding the right place to enter the forest from the road is a little hard, and I end up asking a man if I’m going the right way. He says I am, although he expresses concern that I’m not prepared enough for the trail. “It’s very hard!” he says.

The trail is thankfully easy to follow for most of the morning, although there is one junction near the top of the section with no signage at all. I take an educated guess as to which way I should go, and thankfully that guess pans out.

I eventually work my way all the way back down to the river at the valley floor, and reach the same highway rest area with a bathhouse where I’d come last night with the guesthouse group. This is the only business of any kind for miles, so I go inside again, use the bathhouse, and get some lunch and some ice cream. It’s nice to cool down inside, and hard to go back out into the broiling heat. It’s been like this — over 90°F / 32°C — essentially every day of this hike.

The afternoon section has two passes to climb, the second of which is higher. Everything’s fine until I reach a road at the top of the second pass. At that point, the trail, which has so far been fairly well-signed, seems to have given up on signage altogether. Luckily, I’m close enough to my hotel for the night that I can switch back to walking on the road.

There’s one funny moment when I come around a bend, and through the trees I see an enormous head. This proves to be the head of a giant Buddha statue set against the mountainside. A short while after passing the big Buddha, I reach my hotel. It was probably quite grand at some point in the past, but these days it’s a bit shabby. The room itself is nice, but the hallway carpets haven’t been changed in decades.

I’m slightly apprehensive about eating the hotel’s dinner; this kind of traditional hotel is very likely to serve some dishes — particularly seafood — that I won’t like. Most of the courses turn out to be fine, although I have to pass on the tiny little squids served in ink.
