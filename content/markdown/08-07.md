I’ve been looking forward to today, not only because this is the final day of this long hike, but also because two friends, Miho and Atsushi, are going to meet me early in the morning and hike the final day with me.

We meet at the tiny little Hiraiwa Station near the hotel, and make a short walk towards the Shio no Michi trail. There’s an odd point where each of us is suddenly surrounded by a loud, buzzing swarm of flies (or something) that stay with us for a couple of minutes.

We pass a signpost for the trail and begin to walk on it, but almost immediately the normally well-maintained trail turns into an overgrown thicket. It’s hard to press through the vines and such, some of which have thorns, and the ground underneath is quite uneven and hard to see.

After struggling through this for 5 or 10 minutes, the trail — such as it is — turns sharply up a steep hill. There’s still a lot of overgrowth, but now the ground is covered with loose, unstable rocks. Atsushi is leading, and is having trouble making his way up the hill because he keeps sliding down. Occasionally a rock will begin to roll down the hill and come careening down towards Miho and me.

We’ve only been “hiking” for 15 minutes or so, but we’ve made very little actual progress, and it’s unclear how much further this unmaintained section continues. What’s worrisome is that we’d already expected this section of trail to take a number of hours, and the reality is worse than we’d expected.

This isn’t fun, feels unsafe, and we have no idea when it’ll end. As much as I’d wanted to leave an unbroken trail of footprints across Japan on this trip, it doesn’t make sense to continue. We eventually decide to turn back, and fight our way back down the loose slope and through the thicket to the trailhead.

We walk back to the tiny train station, and get there just as a train is leaving. Sadly, the next train won’t come for a couple of hours. There’s a road going the direction we want — but that road goes through a tunnel that’s 3.5 miles / 5.7 km long! Atsushi calls for a taxi. It’ll take a while to get here, but will still be faster than waiting for the train.

When the taxi comes, we pile in. As he drives us into the tunnel, we laugh at how implausible it would be to try to walk through it. In some places, it’s a dark tunnel; in others, it’s a snowshed: a roof up against the mountainside, with daylight coming in between pillars. Everywhere it’s quite narrow, with many turns that would prevent a car (or truck) from seeing a pedestrian. The chatty driver says that, before the tunnel/snowshed was completed, the road would be buried in deep snow all winter, locking in the people who lived in the tiny towns along it.

We have the driver drop us off at Nechi Station, the first place where we can reasonably resume walking. We pick up the Shio no Michi trail again, and are relieved to see that this section is well maintained. We walk over an easy, forested mountain pass, then down into the outskirts of Itoigawa, a small city on the coast of the Sea of Japan.

At one point we pass a road worker who’s wearing what looks like a thick jacket. As we get closer, we see that the jacket has electric fans built into it. I’ve never seen such a thing before, but with climate change it makes sense. The man’s shape is a little puffy — Miho says he looks like Baymax from “Big Hero 6”.

By now it’s late morning, and we’re all very hot, so we’re looking forward to reaching the seaside. I’d like to end this hike the way I began it: on a beach. The only beach access in the area is a park on the west side of town, and we have to walk a little further to reach that.

When we reach the park, I set down my pack and take off my shoes, then walk into the ocean. It’s surprisingly warm, but still cooler than the air, and it’s nice to dunk beneath the waves.

My hike is over. I've walked across Japan!
