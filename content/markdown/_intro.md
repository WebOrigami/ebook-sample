When Japan finally opened up to tourism again in late 2022, I thought it'd be fun to return to Japan the following summer for a long hike. I decided to hike on my own across the main island of Honshū from the Pacific Coast to the Sea of Japan.

I think a long, contiguous walk is one of the most readily accessible ways for anyone to go have a big adventure of their own.

You don’t need to be especially athletic; your human body is built to walk long distances and will acquire the stamina to do so if you let it.

You don’t need special equipment. You can pick whatever kind of goal, territory, route, or style that sounds good to you.

You will meet all kinds of people, stay in all kinds of places, and eat all kinds of food. Your trip itself will be a very good conversation starter.

You will move at a pace that lets you appreciate what’s around you. You will pass through liminal spaces even locals don’t see.

You will come to accept that the weather can be prepared for, and beyond that it’s generally bearable if you let go of your expectations. The same is true of other things you have no control of.

You will shed unnecessary things, and learn just how little you need to get by.

Planning for the trip took me half a year. I've done several long hikes and bike trips, and enjoy the process of learning about someplace far away, steadily piecing together a route that feels achievable and likely to succeed while retaining some challenge and adventure.

In this case, planning was difficult because few people in Japan do this kind of trip, and in many places it was hard to determine beforehand what a particular area would be like. I have the advantage of being able to read and speak Japanese, without which I couldn't have planned or hiked this particular route. I also have one disadvantage: a fear of heights that ruled out several promising hiking trails because they traversed cliffs that would have made me uncomfortable.

I settled on a route that would take me over steep mountains along a belt of national parks.

The route took in a crossing of Mount Fuji, and portions of the Southern Alps, the Yatsugatake range, the Northern Alps, and the historic Shio no Michi trail. In between, I would walk through valleys with cities, towns, and rural areas. The route was roughly 270 miles (434 km) long and would cover some 60,000 ft (18,200 m) of elevation gain. My goal was not to hike all day, but to leave time each day to rest, hang out, and where possible visit points of interest.

On hikes I don't bring much: a change of clothes, layers for rain and cold, hiking poles, some small gear items, and things like a satellite texting device for emergencies. Japan's hiking areas include a network of huts offering simple lodging and food, and planning my route around those obviated the need for a tent, sleeping bag, air mattress, or stove.

That said, in the urban areas I planned to stay in hotels and eat in restaurants, some of which would be quite nice. So I added an extra outfit of lightweight street clothes and a pair of ultralight city shoes I found online. For writing I brought an iPad Mini and a thin, folding Bluetooth keyboard.

All this stuff went into a small day pack, and weighed about 10 pounds or a little under 5 kilos — not the lightest I've travelled, but still quite comfortable to carry all day. On top of that, I'd carry a couple liters of water or sports drink and a pile of convenience store snacks.

I timed my trip to arrive just after the seasonal opening of the trail that skirts the caldera at the summit of Mount Fuji. As it happened, I arrived on the first day of an extended heat wave that would last for the entire hike. I would be hiking in mountain prefectures to which Japan's city residents historically retreat to escape summer heat — but this year the temperature and humidity would be oppressive everywhere I went.

Still, this turned out to be a grand adventure, and I wouldn't have traded it for anything.
