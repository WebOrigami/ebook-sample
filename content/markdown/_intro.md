In late 2022, Japan finally opened up to tourism again after the pandemic. I thought it'd be fun to go back to Japan in the summer of 2023 and take the opportunity to do a long hike. I decided to hike across the main island of Honshū from the Pacific Coast to the Sea of Japan.

My route took me over steep mountains in a number of national parks, including Mt. Fuji and portions of the Southern Alps, the Yatsugatake range, the Northern Alps, and the Shio no Michi Trail. In between, I walked through cities, towns, and rural areas. It took four weeks.

I think a long, contiguous walk is one of the most readily accessible ways for anyone to go have a big adventure of their own.

You don’t need special equipment.

You can pick whatever kind of goal, route, or style sounds good to you.

You will meet all kinds of people, stay in all kinds of places, and eat all kinds of food.

Your trip itself will be a very good conversation starter.

You will pass through liminal spaces even locals don’t see.

You will move at a pace that lets you appreciate what’s around you.

You will learn to shed unnecessary things.

You will come to accept that the weather (like other things you have no control of) can be prepared for, and beyond that it’s generally bearable if you can let go of your expectations.

You don’t need to be especially athletic; your human body is built to walk long distances and will acquire the stamina to do so if you let it.
