When Japan finally opened up to tourism again in late 2022, I thought it'd be fun to return to Japan in the summer of 2023 for a long hike. I decided to hike on my own across the main island of Honshū from the Pacific Coast to the Sea of Japan.

I think a long, contiguous walk is one of the most readily accessible ways for anyone to go have a big adventure of their own.

You don’t need to be especially athletic; your human body is built to walk long distances and will acquire the stamina to do so if you let it.

You don’t need special equipment. You can pick whatever kind of goal, territory, route, or style sounds good to you.

You will stay in all kinds of places, eat all kinds of food, and meet all kinds of people. Your trip itself will be a very good conversation starter.

You will move at a pace that lets you appreciate what’s around you. You will pass through liminal spaces even locals don’t see.

You will come to accept that the weather can be prepared for, and beyond that it’s generally bearable if you let go of your expectations. The same is true of other unforeseen circumstances you have no control of.

You will shed unnecessary things, and learn just how little you need to get by.

Planning the trip took me half a year. I've done several long hikes and bike trips, and enjoy the process of learning about someplace far away. I steadily pieced together a route that felt achievable and likely to succeed while retaining substantial challenge and adventure.

One planning hurdle was that few people in Japan do this kind of trip, so in many places it was hard to determine beforehand what a particular area would be like. I have the advantage of being able to read and speak Japanese, without which I couldn't have planned or hiked this particular route. I also have one disadvantage: a fear of heights that ruled out several promising trails that unfortunately traversed significant cliffs.

I settled on a route that would take me over steep mountains along a belt of national parks.

The route took in a crossing of Mount Fuji and portions of the Southern Alps, the Yatsugatake range, the Northern Alps, and the historic Shio no Michi trail. In between, I would walk through valleys with cities, towns, and rural areas. The route was roughly 270 miles (434 km) long and would cover some 60,000 ft (18,200 m) of elevation gain. My goal was not to hike all day, but to leave time each day to rest, hang out, and where possible visit points of interest.

On hikes I don't bring much: a change of clothes, layers for rain and cold, hiking poles, some small gear items, and things like a satellite texting device for emergencies. Japan's hiking areas include a network of huts offering simple lodging and food, and planning my route around those obviated the need for a tent, sleeping bag, air mattress, or stove.

That said, in the urban areas I planned to stay in hotels and eat in restaurants, some of which would be quite nice, so I added an extra outfit of lightweight street clothes and a pair of ultralight city shoes I found online. For writing I brought a little tablet and a very small folding keyboard.

All this stuff went into a little day pack, and weighed about 10 pounds or a little under 5 kilos — not the lightest I've travelled, but still quite comfortable to carry all day. On top of that, I'd carry a couple liters of water or sports drink and a pile of convenience store snacks.

I timed my trip to arrive just after the seasonal opening of the trail that skirts the caldera at the summit of Mount Fuji. As it happened, I arrived on the first day of an extended heat wave that would last for the entire hike. Japan's mountain prefectures are where city residents normally retreat to escape summer heat — but this year the temperature and humidity would be oppressive everywhere I went.

Still, this turned out to be a grand adventure, and I wouldn't have traded it for anything.
